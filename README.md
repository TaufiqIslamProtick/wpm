# wpm
The acronym wpm stands for words per minute.

## Description of the dataset
The dataset is the file data.csv. There are twenty-three columns in it. The first one is the date, followed by twenty trials, the average of the trials, and a column for comments.

## What an empty cell mean in a column
An empty cell in the column Date will be highly unusual as this is generated by dragging the initial cell for dates as much as possible.
An empty cell in any of the i-th trial column would mean that the i-th trial was never taken.
An empty cell in the average column means that there were no tests taken on that day.
An empty cell in the comment column means that no comments were made after the tests were taken for that day.

## Objective
The objective of this project is analyze one's typing speed data. If someone is getting started to learn speed-typing, they may get interested to look at some stats. For eample: 
1. Their averge of the average daily scores over a period of time. 
2. Their maximum and minimum individual scores so far. 
3. Their longest streak. 
4. A visual representation of averge daily score against time. 
5. A regression model that tries to fit a stratght line to the data. 
6. The intercept and the slope of the model.
